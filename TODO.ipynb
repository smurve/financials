    "\n",
    "#### 1) Operationalization\n",
    "- Make training runnable as script\n",
    "- introduce MLFlow\n",
    "- Log for Tensorboard\n",
    "- save the model at certain checkpoints\n",
    "- introduce reproducible random\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Get the market simulator ready for DDPG\n",
    "- Pre-train a larger model on SINX?\n",
    "- *DONE* - Experiment w randomly generated sentiments $\\phi(t)$, possibly as random walks. See: [PortfolioActor.ipynb](PortfolioActor.ipynb) \n",
    "- *DONE* - [Market_with_Inertia.ipynb](Market_with_Inertia.ipynb) now has a market model that reliably creates loads of 4y stock price histories\n",
    "- Generate zillions of 4y charts. [Market_with_Inertia.ipynb] (Market_with_Inertia.ipynb) has the code\n",
    "- *DONE* - create a trading_model.StockMarket instance from the above data to power up the RL environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Feature Extraction and model\n",
    "- Start with the simple ```statsutils.avg_over_axis``` from static data (128 down to 16) and observe (lack of) convergence.\n",
    "- Extract various moving averages\n",
    "- Extract various downsamplings\n",
    "- Expand the convnet architecture to deal with more features\n",
    "- Have a larger and varying history input\n",

    "#### 3) Documentation\n",
    "- Really wanna do a paper? As long as I don't get into believing it's a real paper, ...ok."
